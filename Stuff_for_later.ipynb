The History Of A Family\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter I.\\nFyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov\\n\\n\\nAlexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch\\nKaramazov, a land owner well known in our district in his own day, and\\nstill remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which\\nhappened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper\\nplace. For the present I will only say that this “landowner”—for so we\\nused to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own\\nestate—was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a\\ntype abject and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one\\nof those senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after\\ntheir worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor\\nPavlovitch, for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of\\nthe smallest; he ran to dine at other men’s tables, and fastened on\\nthem as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred\\nthousand roubles in hard cash. At the same time, he was all his life\\none of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district. I\\nrepeat, it was not stupidity—the majority of these fantastical fellows\\nare shrewd and intelligent enough—but just senselessness, and a\\npeculiar national form of it.\\n\\nHe was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by his\\nfirst wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor\\nPavlovitch’s first wife, Adelaïda Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich\\nand distinguished noble family, also landowners in our district, the\\nMiüsovs. How it came to pass that an heiress, who was also a beauty,\\nand moreover one of those vigorous, intelligent girls, so common in\\nthis generation, but sometimes also to be found in the last, could have\\nmarried such a worthless, puny weakling, as we all called him, I won’t\\nattempt to explain. I knew a young lady of the last “romantic”\\ngeneration who after some years of an enigmatic passion for a\\ngentleman, whom she might quite easily have married at any moment,\\ninvented insuperable obstacles to their union, and ended by throwing\\nherself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapid river from a high\\nbank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely to satisfy her own\\ncaprice, and to be like Shakespeare’s Ophelia. Indeed, if this\\nprecipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers, had been less\\npicturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, most\\nlikely the suicide would never have taken place. This is a fact, and\\nprobably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two or\\nthree generations. Adelaïda Ivanovna Miüsov’s action was similarly, no\\ndoubt, an echo of other people’s ideas, and was due to the irritation\\ncaused by lack of mental freedom. She wanted, perhaps, to show her\\nfeminine independence, to override class distinctions and the despotism\\nof her family. And a pliable imagination persuaded her, we must\\nsuppose, for a brief moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his\\nparasitic position, was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that\\nprogressive epoch, though he was, in fact, an ill‐natured buffoon and\\nnothing more. What gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded\\nby an elopement, and this greatly captivated Adelaïda Ivanovna’s fancy.\\nFyodor Pavlovitch’s position at the time made him specially eager for\\nany such enterprise, for he was passionately anxious to make a career\\nin one way or another. To attach himself to a good family and obtain a\\ndowry was an alluring prospect. As for mutual love it did not exist\\napparently, either in the bride or in him, in spite of Adelaïda\\nIvanovna’s beauty. This was, perhaps, a unique case of the kind in the\\nlife of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was always of a voluptuous temper, and\\nready to run after any petticoat on the slightest encouragement. She\\nseems to have been the only woman who made no particular appeal to his\\nsenses.\\n\\nImmediately after the elopement Adelaïda Ivanovna discerned in a flash\\nthat she had no feeling for her husband but contempt. The marriage\\naccordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary\\nrapidity. Although the family accepted the event pretty quickly and\\napportioned the runaway bride her dowry, the husband and wife began to\\nlead a most disorderly life, and there were everlasting scenes between\\nthem. It was said that the young wife showed incomparably more\\ngenerosity and dignity than Fyodor Pavlovitch, who, as is now known,\\ngot hold of all her money up to twenty‐five thousand roubles as soon as\\nshe received it, so that those thousands were lost to her for ever. The\\nlittle village and the rather fine town house which formed part of her\\ndowry he did his utmost for a long time to transfer to his name, by\\nmeans of some deed of conveyance. He would probably have succeeded,\\nmerely from her moral fatigue and desire to get rid of him, and from\\nthe contempt and loathing he aroused by his persistent and shameless\\nimportunity. But, fortunately, Adelaïda Ivanovna’s family intervened\\nand circu'"
